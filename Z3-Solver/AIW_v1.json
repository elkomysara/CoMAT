    "prompt": "Reformulate the following problem as a relational database SQL programming problem. Problem: \"Alice has four sisters and a brother. How many sisters in total does Alice's brother have?\"",
    "gpt_result": "To reformulate the problem as a relational database SQL programming problem, we need to define a database schema that represents the relationships between Alice, her sisters, and her brother. We will then write an SQL query to find the answer.\n\n### Database Schema\n\n1. **Tables:**\n   - `Persons`: This table will store information about each person.\n     - `id`: Primary key, unique identifier for each person.\n     - `name`: Name of the person.\n\n   - `Siblings`: This table will store sibling relationships between persons.\n     - `person_id`: Foreign key referencing `Persons(id)`, represents one sibling.\n     - `sibling_id`: Foreign key referencing `Persons(id)`, represents the other sibling.\n\n### SQL Problem Formulation\n\n1. **Insert Data:**\n   - Insert Alice, her four sisters, and her brother into the `Persons` table.\n   - Insert sibling relationships into the `Siblings` table.\n\n2. **SQL Query:**\n   - Write an SQL query to find the number of sisters Alice's brother has.\n\n### SQL Implementation\n\n```sql\n-- Create the Persons table\nCREATE TABLE Persons (\n    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR(50)\n);\n\n-- Create the Siblings table\nCREATE TABLE Siblings (\n    person_id INT,\n    sibling_id INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES Persons(id),\n    FOREIGN KEY (sibling_id) REFERENCES Persons(id)\n);\n\n-- Insert data into Persons table\nINSERT INTO Persons (id, name) VALUES\n(1, 'Alice'),\n(2, 'Sister1'),\n(3, 'Sister2'),\n(4, 'Sister3'),\n(5, 'Sister4'),\n(6, 'Brother');\n\n-- Insert sibling relationships into Siblings table\n-- Alice's siblings\nINSERT INTO Siblings (person_id, sibling_id) VALUES\n(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6),\n(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1);\n\n-- Sisters' relationships\nINSERT INTO Siblings (person_id, sibling_id) VALUES\n(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6),\n(3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6),\n(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6),\n(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6);\n\n-- Brother's relationships\nINSERT INTO Siblings (person_id, sibling_id) VALUES\n(6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5);\n\n-- Query to find the number of sisters Alice's brother has\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS number_of_sisters\nFROM Siblings\nJOIN Persons ON Siblings.sibling_id = Persons.id\nWHERE Siblings.person_id = 6 AND Persons.name LIKE 'Sister%';\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We create two tables: `Persons` to store each person's information and `Siblings` to store sibling relationships.\n- We insert Alice, her four sisters, and her brother into the `Persons` table.\n- We insert the sibling relationships into the `Siblings` table, ensuring that each sibling relationship is bidirectional.\n- Finally, we write an SQL query to count the number of sisters Alice's brother has by joining the `Siblings` table with the `Persons` table and filtering for entries where the sibling's name starts with 'Sister'.\n\n### Answer: 4",

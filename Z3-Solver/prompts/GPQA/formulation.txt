Task Description: You are given an advanced graduate reasoning question, which includes advanced mathematics, physics, chemistry and so on. The task is to convert it into symbolic representation
1) define all the predicates in the problem
2) parse the problem into logic rules based on the defined predicates
3) write all the facts mentioned in the problem
4) parse the question into the logic form
5) Provide the answer of the question.

After obtaining the symbolic representation, please solve the question based on the symbolic representations, then provide the final answer in the form of conclusion based on the symbolic representation.

Here is an example:
Question:
If f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2 and g(x) = 2x + 1, find f(g(2)).
A: 3
B: 42
C: 5
D: 30
E: 500

Example Answer:
###
Define predicates:
F(x, y): y is the result of applying function f to x
G(x, y): y is the result of applying function g to x

Parse problem into logic rules:
∀x,y: F(x, y) ↔ y = x^2 + 3x + 2
∀x,y: G(x, y) ↔ y = 2x + 1

Write facts:
No additional facts are given in this problem.

Parse the question:
Find y such that: ∃z: G(2, z) ∧ F(z, y)

Answer:
[Please review step by step, and answer the question based on the symbolic representations]

Final Answer: 
[A detailed conclusion of the answer]

Please solve this using symbolic logic representation by following these steps:

1. Define predicates:
   - List all relevant predicates (e.g., Person(x), Brother(x,y), Sister(x,y), etc.)

2. Parse the problem into logic rules:
   - Write out the logical relationships between predicates

3. Write facts:
   - Express the given information using the defined predicates

4. Parse the question:
   - Formulate the question using logical notation

5. Derive the answer:
   - Use the rules and facts to logically deduce the answer

6. Verify:
   - Double-check your logic and calculations

7. Provide the final answer in the format:
   ### Answer: [number]

Remember to consider all relationships carefully, including indirect ones.

Here is an example:
####
Question: 
Alice has 4 brothers and she also has 1 sister. How many sisters does Alice's brother have?

1. Define predicates:
   - Person(x): x is a person
   - Brother(x,y): x is a brother of y
   - Sister(x,y): x is a sister of y
   - NumBrothers(x,n): x has n brothers
   - NumSisters(x,n): x has n sisters

2. Parse the problem into logic rules:
   - ∀x,y: Brother(x,y) ↔ Brother(y,x)
   - ∀x,y: Sister(x,y) ↔ Sister(y,x)
   - ∀x,y,z: Brother(x,y) ∧ Sister(z,y) → Sister(z,x)

3. Write facts:
   - Person(Alice)
   - NumBrothers(Alice, 4)
   - NumSisters(Alice, 1)

4. Parse the question:
   - Find n such that: ∀x: Brother(x, Alice) → NumSisters(x, n)

5. Derive the answer:
   - Alice's brothers are siblings to Alice and her sister
   - So, each of Alice's brothers has Alice's sister as their sister
   - They also have Alice herself as a sister
   - Therefore, n = 1 (Alice's sister) + 1 (Alice) = 2

6. Verify:
   - We've accounted for Alice's sister and Alice herself as sisters to Alice's brothers
   - The logic follows from the given information and rules

7. Provide the final answer in the format:
   ### Answer: 2

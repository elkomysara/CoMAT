Task Description: You are given a mathematical question from college mathematics. The task is to first convert it into symbolic representation and answer based on the symbolic representation with only a single letter.\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college mathematics.\n
1) define all the predicates in the problem
2) parse the problem into logic rules based on the defined predicates
3) write all the facts mentioned in the problem
4) parse the question into the logic form
5) Provide the answer of the question.

Here is an example:
Question:
If f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2 and g(x) = 2x + 1, find f(g(2)).
A: 3
B: 42
C: 5
D: 30

Example Answer:
###
Define predicates:
F(x, y): y is the result of applying function f to x
G(x, y): y is the result of applying function g to x
Parse problem into logic rules:
∀x,y: F(x, y) ↔ y = x^2 + 3x + 2
∀x,y: G(x, y) ↔ y = 2x + 1
Write facts:
No additional facts are given in this problem.
Parse the question:
Find y such that: ∃z: G(2, z) ∧ F(z, y)

Final Answer: B

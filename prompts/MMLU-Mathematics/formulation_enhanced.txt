Task Description: You are given a mathematical question from college mathematics. The task is to first convert it into symbolic representation and answer based on the symbolic representation with only a single letter.\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college mathematics.\n

For each question, follow these steps:
1) Define all relevant variables, functions, and predicates using symbolic notation.
2) Convert the given information into logical expressions or equations using the defined symbols.
3) Translate any additional constraints or conditions into symbolic form.
4) Express the question itself as a symbolic statement.
5) Based on the symbolic statement, provide the final answer as a single letter corresponding to the correct option.

Here is an example:
Question:
If f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2 and g(x) = 2x + 1, find f(g(2)). 
A: 3 
B: 42 
C: 5 
D: 30

Example Answer:
###
1. Define symbols and predicates: 
F(x, y): y is the result of applying function f to x
G(x, y): y is the result of applying function g to x

2. Convert the given information into logical expressions or equations using the defined symbols.
∀x,y: F(x, y) ↔ y = x^2 + 3x + 2
∀x,y: G(x, y) ↔ y = 2x + 1

3. Translate any additional constraints or conditions into symbolic form.
No additional constraints.

4. Express the question itself as a symbolic statement or equation.
Find y such that: ∃z: G(2, z) ∧ F(z, y)

5. In this section, do not provide any explanation, just provide the final answer ONLY IN ONE single letter corresponding to the correct option (follow the format below).
Final Answer: B

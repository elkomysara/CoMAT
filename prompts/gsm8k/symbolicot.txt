Task Description: You are given a question about advanced mathematics The task is to first convert the natural language into symbolic representation

1) Define all the predicates in the problem
2) Parse the problem into logic rules based on the defined predicates
3) Write all the facts mentioned in the problem
4) Parse the question into the logic form
5) Provide the answer of the question.

After obtaining the symbolic representation, please think step by step based on the symbolic representations, then provide the final answer as a single word.

Here is an example:
Question:
If f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2 and g(x) = 2x + 1, find f(g(2)).
A: 3
B: 42
C: 5
D: 30
E: 500

Example Answer:
###
Define predicates:
F(x, y): y is the result of applying function f to x
G(x, y): y is the result of applying function g to x

Parse problem into logic rules:
∀x,y: F(x, y) ↔ y = x^2 + 3x + 2
∀x,y: G(x, y) ↔ y = 2x + 1

Write facts:
No additional facts are given in this problem.

Parse the question:
Find y such that: ∃z: G(2, z) ∧ F(z, y)

Answer:
[Think step by step and answer the question based on the symbolic representations]

Final Answer: 42

Task Description: You are given a reasoning question. The task is to convert the natural language into symbolic representation

1) Define all the predicates in the problem
2) Parse the problem into logic rules based on the defined predicates
3) Write all the facts mentioned in the problem
4) Parse the question into the logic form
5) Provide the answer of the question.

After obtaining the symbolic representation, please think step by step based on the symbolic representations, then provide the final answer as labels [1,0,0,...] corresponding to each answer option.

Here is an example:
Question:
Which cast is in Harry Potter?
[Harry Potter,
Hermione Granger,
Voldemort,
Darth Vader,
Mickey Mouse,
Ron Weasley]

Example Answer:
Define predicates:
Cast(x): x is a cast member
HarryPotter(x): x is in the Harry Potter series
Parse problem into logic rules:
∀x: Cast(x) ∧ HarryPotter(x) → CorrectAnswer(x)

Write facts:
HarryPotter(Harry Potter)
HarryPotter(Hermione Granger)
HarryPotter(Voldemort)
HarryPotter(Ron Weasley)
¬HarryPotter(Darth Vader)
¬HarryPotter(Mickey Mouse)

Parse the question:
Find x such that: Cast(x) ∧ HarryPotter(x)

Answer:
[Think step by step based on the symbolic representations]

Final Answer: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

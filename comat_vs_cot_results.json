    "question": "The distance between Miriam\u2019s house and Debbie\u2019s house is 44.44 meters. Which statement about the values of the digits in the distance, in meters, is true?",
    "CoMAT_Result": "To solve the question using the CoMAT approach, we will break down the problem step by step:\n\n**1. Comprehension:**  \n   - Identify the key figures: The distance between Miriam's house and Debbie's house is 44.44 meters.\n   - The question asks about the values of the digits in this number.\n\n**2. Manipulation:**  \n   - Analyze the number 44.44, determining the place value of each '4':\n     - The first '4' is in the tens place: \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\).\n     - The second '4' is in the ones place: \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\).\n     - The third '4' is in the tenths place: \\(4 \\times 0.1 = 0.4\\).\n     - The fourth '4' is in the hundredths place: \\(4 \\times 0.01 = 0.04\\).\n\n**",
    "CoT_Result": "To solve this question using the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach, let\u2019s break down the problem and analyze the value of each digit in the given number, 44.44.\n\n1. **Identify each digit and its place value**:\n   - The first digit '4' is in the tens place.\n   - The second digit '4' is in the ones place.\n   - The third digit '4' is in the tenths place.\n   - The fourth digit '4' is in the hundredths place.\n\n2. **Calculate the value of each digit based on its place**:\n   - The '4' in the tens place represents 4 tens, which is 40.\n   - The '4' in the ones place represents 4 ones, which is 4.\n   - The '4' in the tenths place represents 4 tenths, which is 0.4.\n   - The '4' in the hundredths place represents "

These are the cubes that are not on the outermost layer of the hollow cube.\n   - The outermost layer of the hollow cube is a shell of 1 cm thickness, which means it covers the entire outer surface.\n   - The cubes that are not on the outermost layer are those that form the inner surface of the hollow cube, which is a cube of side 3 cm.\n   - Therefore, the number of smaller cubes that remain unpainted on any face is the number of cubes in the inner hollow part, which is 27.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted:**\n   - Each of the 27 smaller cubes in the inner hollow part has 6 faces, but since they are completely inside, none of their faces are painted.\n   - Therefore, the number of unpainted faces is \\(27 \\times 6 = 162\\).\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of smaller cubes that remain unpainted on any face, not the number of unpainted faces.

Since U is the midpoint of ST, we can express the positions of the points as follows:\n   - Let R be at position 0 on the line.\n   - Then S is at position 5 (since RS = 5).\n   - T is at position 5 + 22 = 27 (since ST = 22).\n   - U, being the midpoint of ST, is at position (5 + 27)/2 = 16.\n\n3.

Find the LCM of 13 and 7:\n   - The prime factors of 13 are just 13 (since 13 is a prime number).\n   - The prime factors of 7 are just 7 (since 7 is a prime number).\n   - The LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest power of all prime factors present in either number.\n   - LCM(13, 7) = 13 * 7 = 91.\n\n3.

At \\( t = 60 \\), the lake is fully covered, so \\( 2^{60/2} = 2^{30} \\) is the number of lilies needed to fully cover the lake.\n4. Now, if we start with 64 lilies, we need to find out how many days it will take for these 64 lilies to become \\( 2^{30} \\) lilies.\n5.

Point B bisects minor arc AC, which means that arc AB = arc BC = 160\u00b0 / 2 = 80\u00b0.\n3. We are also given that minor arc BD is 150\u00b0.\n\nNow, we need to find the measure of minor arc AD.\n\n4. Since B bisects arc AC, we have:\n   - Arc AB = 80\u00b0\n   - Arc BC = 80\u00b0\n\n5. Arc BD is given as 150\u00b0, and since B is between A and D, we can express arc AD as the sum of arcs AB and BD.\n\n6. Therefore, arc AD = arc AB + arc BD = 80\u00b0 + 150\u00b0 = 230\u00b0.\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a circle, the total degrees in a circle is 360\u00b0. We need to find the minor arc AD, which is the smaller arc between A and D.\n\n7. To find the minor arc AD, we need to subtract the larger arc from 360\u00b0:\n   - Larger arc (arc BCD) = arc BC + arc CD = 80\u00b0 + (360\u00b0 - 150\u00b0) = 80\u00b0 + 210\u00b0 = 290\u00b0.\n   - Minor arc AD = 360\u00b0 - 290\u00b0 = 70\u00b0.\n\nBut, we made a mistake in the calculation. Let's correct it:\n\n8. Since arc BD is 150\u00b0, and arc BC is 80\u00b0, arc CD = 150\u00b0 - 80\u00b0 = 70\u00b0.\n\n9. Now, arc AD = arc AB + arc BD = 80\u00b0 + 150\u00b0 = 230\u00b0.\n\n10. Since 230\u00b0 is not a minor arc, we need to find the complement to 360\u00b0:\n    - Minor arc AD = 360\u00b0 - 230\u00b0 = 130\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 130\u00b0.\n\nFinal Answer: B",

Therefore, 75 employees take a winter vacation.\n\n3. **Neither Vacation**: 20% of employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

    "gpt_result": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the total income, the median income, and the number of family members.\n\n1. **Total Income**: The total income of the family is $9000.\n\n2. **Median Income**: The median income is $3000. The median is the middle value when the incomes are arranged in order. This means that half of the family members earn less than or equal to $3000, and the other half earn more than or equal to $3000.\n\n3. **Number of Members**: We need to find the number of family members.\n\nSince the median is $3000, and it is the middle value, the number of family members must be odd. This is because, for an odd number of members, the median is the income of the middle member when all incomes are sorted.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\n- **Option A (2 members)**: With 2 members, the median would be the average of the two incomes, not a single income. So, this is not possible.\n\n- **Option B (3 members)**: With 3 members, the median would be the income of the second member when sorted. This is possible.\n\n- **Option C (4 members)**: With 4 members, the median would be the average of the second and third incomes, not a single income. So, this is not possible.\n\n- **Option D (5 members)**: With 5 members, the median would be the income of the third member when sorted. This is possible.\n\n- **Option E (6 members)**: With 6 members, the median would be the average of the third and fourth incomes, not a single income. So, this is not possible.\n\nNow, let's check the possible options (3 and 5 members) to see which one fits the total income of $9000.\n\n- **3 Members**: If there are 3 members, the median is the income of the second member. Let's assume the incomes are $x_1 \\leq 3000 \\leq x_3$. The total income is $x_1 + 3000 + x_3 = 9000$. Solving for $x_1 + x_3$, we get $x_1 + x_3 = 6000$. This is possible.\n\n- **5 Members**: If there are 5 members, the median is the income of the third member. Let's assume the incomes are $x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq 3000 \\leq x_4 \\leq x_5$. The total income is $x_1 + x_2 + 3000 + x_4 + x_5 = 9000$. Solving for $x_1 + x_2 + x_4 + x_5$, we get $x_1 + x_2 + x_4 + x_5 = 6000$. This is also possible.\n\nHowever, the problem does not provide enough information to definitively choose between 3 and 5 members based solely on the total and median incomes. But since the median is a single value and the simplest case is often preferred, the most straightforward assumption is that there are 3 members.\n\nFinal Answer: B",

This means if the height is 2x, the semi-perimeter is 5x.\n\n2. **Cost of Papering**: The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260. The paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 meters) and costs Rs. 2 per meter. Therefore, the total length of paper used is Rs. 260 / Rs. 2 per meter = 130 meters.\n\n3. **Area of Paper Used**: Since the paper is 0.5 meters wide, the area covered by the paper is 130 meters * 0.5 meters = 65 square meters.\n\n4. **Area of Walls**: The total area of the walls is the area covered by the paper plus the area of doors and windows. The area of doors and windows is given as 15 square meters. Therefore, the total area of the walls is 65 square meters + 15 square meters = 80 square meters.\n\n5. **Finding the Height**: Let the perimeter of the room be P. The semi-perimeter is P/2 = 5x.

This means we are choosing 2 balls from the remaining n-1 balls.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 balls from n-1 balls is C(n-1, 2) = (n-1)(n-2)/2.\n\nWe are told that this number is 45. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\n(n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) = 90\n\nNow, expand the left side:\n\nn^2 - 3n + 2 = 90\n\nSubtract 90 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\nn^2 - 3n + 2 - 90 = 0\n\nn^2 - 3n - 88 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula, n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a, where a = 1, b = -3, and c = -88.\n\nFirst, calculate the discriminant:\n\nb^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4(1)(-88) = 9 + 352 = 361\n\nThe square root of 361 is 19.\n\nNow, apply the quadratic formula:\n\nn = [3 \u00b1 19] / 2\n\nThis gives us two potential solutions:\n\nn = (3 + 19) / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11\n\nn = (3 - 19) / 2 = -16 / 2 = -8\n\nSince n must be a positive integer, we discard n = -8.\n\nTherefore, the value of n is 11.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that the difference in age between Joe and his father is the same as the difference in age between Joe's father and his sister's age when she was as old as her father. So, F - J = 2(F - S).\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\nFrom equation 2: F - J = S\n\nFrom equation 3: F - J = 2(F - S)\n\nSubstitute F - J = S into the second equation:\n\nS = 2(F - S)\n\nS = 2F - 2S\n\n3S = 2F\n\nS = (2/3)F\n\nNow substitute S = (2/3)F into equation 1:\n\nJ + (2/3)F + F = 100\n\nJ + (5/3)F = 100\n\nNow, substitute F - J = S into J + (5/3)F = 100:\n\nJ = F - S\n\nJ = F - (2/3)F\n\nJ = (1/3)F\n\nSubstitute J = (1/3)F into J + (5/3)F = 100:\n\n(1/3)F + (5/3)F = 100\n\n(6/3)F = 100\n\n2F = 100\n\nF = 50\n\nTherefore, Joe's father's age is 50.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

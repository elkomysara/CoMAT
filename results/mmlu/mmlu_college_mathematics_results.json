This is a classic problem in graph theory known as the \"graph coloring problem,\" where each node (student) must be assigned a color (team) such that no two adjacent nodes (students who dislike each other) share the same color.\n\nGiven that each student dislikes exactly three other students, the graph is a 3-regular graph.
